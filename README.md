# GameOfThronesSupplyChain
This project is a simulation of resource management in the world of "Game of Thrones". It involves managing a royal warehouse of resources and distributing these resources to the great houses of Westeros based on their preferences and needs.

## Features

- **Resource Hierarchy**: The project includes a hierarchy of classes for different types of resources such as livestock, feed, and fruits.
- **Royal Warehouse**: The warehouse stores different quantities of each type of resource.
- **Great Houses of Westeros**: Each house is represented as a linked list. The houses are stored in a binary search tree, with the number of people in each house serving as the key.
- **Resource Distribution**: The project includes an algorithm for distributing resources from the warehouse to the houses. The distribution is done by using a backtracking search algorithm in such a way that each house receives resources according to its preferences and needs.
